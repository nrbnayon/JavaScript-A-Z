// Variable Data type categorized into two main categories: primitive data types and non-primitive/reference data types.
//------------------------

/**
 * 1. "String"  --- let str = "Hello";
 * 2. Number    --- let num = 10;
 * 3. Boolean   --- let isTrue = true;
 * 4. Null      --- let y = null;
 * 5. Undefined --- let x;
 * 6. Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6): Represents a unique identifier. Example: let sym = Symbol('foo');
 * This data type are Primitive Data Types
 *
 * 7. Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs. Example: let obj = { key: "value" };
 * 8. Array: Represents a collection of elements, ordered and accessed by index. Example: let arr = [1, 2, 3];
 * 9. Function: Represents a reusable block of code. Example: function myFunction() { ... }
 * 10. Date: Represents a specific moment in time. Example: let date = new Date();
 *  This data type are non-primitive/reference data types.

// Variable  naming Convention:  best practice is camelCase and some of are: snake_case, PascalCase
